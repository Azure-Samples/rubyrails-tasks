# Ruby on Rails sample for Azure App Service

This is a sample application that you can use to follow along with the tutorial at 
[Build a Ruby on Rails and MySQL web app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/tutorial-ruby-mysql-app). 

This sample application is generated from the default Rails project and modified minimally to make it work with Azure App Service.
